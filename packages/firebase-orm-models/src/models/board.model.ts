/**
 * The task-breakdown AC's own tile-type list (plan `13 §E11.2`: "tile types
 * (line/bar/big-number/table/funnel)") — a deliberately smaller vocabulary
 * than `10-product-ux.md §2.2`'s fuller wishlist (area/cohort-heatmap/pie/
 * map/AI-note/iframe), the same "AC over wishlist" scoping every prior
 * KAN-3x/4x story in this codebase already applied to its own spec section.
 * `heatmap` (KAN-62) is the first addition past that original five — a
 * cohort_month x period_number matrix, plugged into this same "one metric,
 * time-bucketed, broken down by dimensions" query shape rather than a
 * bespoke two-dimension query of its own: its one required dimension (see
 * `validateTiles` in `board.service.ts`) supplies the matrix's *column*
 * axis (e.g. `period_number`), while the board's own time bucketing
 * (already every other tile type's row/x-axis) supplies the matrix's *row*
 * axis — a metric registered against `fact_cohort_retention` with
 * `timeColumn: 'cohort_month'` buckets naturally into one row per cohort
 * month. A board rendering a heatmap tile should set its own date-range
 * `grain` to `'month'` — a finer grain would split/merge cohort months in a
 * way this v1 doesn't guard against.
