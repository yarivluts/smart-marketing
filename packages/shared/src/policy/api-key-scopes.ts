/**
 * Permissions a machine-held API key (KAN-28) may carry as a scope. A
 * deliberate subset of the full `Permission` catalog, not the whole thing —
 * the same "least privilege for a non-human principal" reasoning
 * `INVITABLE_ROLES` (`roles.ts`) already applies to org invites. Withheld:
 * `project.manage`/`members.manage`/`billing.manage`/`resources.manage`/
 * `sources.manage` (org/project administration — a leaked long-lived key
 * should never be able to reshape who has access or which connectors/
 * sources exist), `keys.manage` (a key must not be able to mint or revoke
 * other keys), `automation.approve`/`automation.execute` (plan 06 §3:
 * "automation execution rights are a separate, elevated scope" — money-
 * moving actions need a human role, not a bearer token), `pii.read`
 * (plan 08 §5.4's separate PII gate), `plugin.install` (an install is an
 * admin action), and `audit.read` (KAN-44 — a key reading its own org's
 * change history is an admin/operator concern, not something a leaked
 * ingest key should expose). What's left is the machine-appropriate surface: pushing
 * data in, writing schemas/metrics/dashboards, exporting, and using AI
 * tooling. `mcp.read` (KAN-75 — the MCP server's read-tool surface) is
 * included: it is itself already a read-only, least-privilege grant (the
 * same reasoning that keeps `metrics.write` grantable despite its name —
 * there is no separate `*.read` permission in the catalog for any of these
 * surfaces). `mcp.act` does not exist yet — the MCP server's act tools
 * (`propose_action`/`approve_action`, KAN-76) aren't built, so there is
 * nothing yet to withhold or grant; add it (withheld, mirroring
 * `automation.approve`/`automation.execute`) when that story lands.
 * `index.test.ts` pins this as a full partition of `PERMISSIONS` —
 * every permission is either here or in that withheld list, never neither
 * (silently un-grantable) nor both.
